# Hello World with the Play Framework

This is an example "Hello World" application for the Play Framework version 2.3.x. It is converted from the [old Play Framework
Hello World tutorial](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/2.0.x/samples/java/helloworld/app/views/index.scala.html).

## Relevant code

The only things that had to be changed after creating the app using `activator new hello-world play-java` were in these files:

* `app/controllers/Application.java`
* `app/views/*`
* `/conf/routes`
